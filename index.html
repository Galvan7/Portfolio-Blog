                        <h2>Let's start with C++</h2>
                        <p>C++ is one of the world's most popular programming languages.
                            C++ can be found in today's operating systems, Graphical User Interfaces, and embedded
                            systems.
                            C++ is an object-oriented programming language which gives a clear structure to programs and
                            allows code to be reused, lowering development costs.
                            C++ is portable and can be used to develop applications that can be adapted to multiple
                            platforms.
                            C++ is fun and easy to learn.
                            As C++ is close to C, C# and Java, it makes it easy for programmers to switch to C++ or vice
                            versa.</p>

                        <h2>Moving On to Java</h2>
                        <p>JAVA was developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems Inc in the year 1995, later acquired
                            by
                            Oracle Corporation. It is a simple programming language. Java makes writing, compiling, and
                            debugging programming easy. It helps to create reusable code and modular programs. Java is a
                            class-based, object-oriented programming language and is designed to have as few
                            implementation
                            dependencies as possible. A general-purpose programming language made for developers to
                            write
                            once run anywhere that is compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java.
                            Java
                            applications are compiled to byte code that can run on any Java Virtual Machine. The syntax
                            of
                            Java is similar to c/c++.</p>

                        <h2>King of languages,Python</h2>
                        <p>Python is a widely used general-purpose, high level programming language. It was created by
                            Guido
                            van Rossum in 1991 and further developed by the Python Software Foundation. It was designed
                            with
                            an emphasis on code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express their concepts
                            in
                            fewer lines of code.
                            Python is a programming language that lets you work quickly and integrate systems more
                            efficiently.
                            There are two major Python versions: Python 2 and Python 3. Both are quite different.</p>
